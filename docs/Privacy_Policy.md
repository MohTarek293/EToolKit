# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-08

EToolKit (“the Add-in”) is a desktop add-in for Autodesk Revit developed by Mohamed Tarek (“Developer”, “we”, “us”).

This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use EToolKit.

---

## 1. Summary

EToolKit does **not** collect or store Revit model data, personal information, analytics, or telemetry **for the Developer**.

However, EToolKit may interact with **third-party services** (Autodesk, Google, GitHub) when you use certain optional features, and those services may process data under their own privacy policies.

---

## 2. Data We Do Not Collect

The Developer does not collect:
- Revit model files or model content
- Personal information (name, email, phone, etc.)
- Usage analytics or telemetry controlled by the Developer

---

## 3. Third-Party Services

### 3.1 Autodesk Entitlement API (Licensing Validation)

If EToolKit is distributed through Autodesk App Store with trial/subscription licensing, the Add-in may validate your entitlement by calling Autodesk’s entitlement endpoint:

`https://apps.autodesk.com/webservices/checkentitlement`

**Data involved:** your Autodesk signed-in user identifier (LoginUserId) and the AppId used for entitlement validation.  
**Processed by:** Autodesk (not the Developer).

Autodesk processing is governed by Autodesk’s Privacy Statement and terms.

---

### 3.2 Feedback / New Ideas Forms (Google Forms)

EToolKit includes optional buttons that open Google Forms (for feedback and feature requests) in your web browser.

Submitting a form is optional. Any information you provide in the form is processed by Google and the form owner according to their policies.

---

### 3.3 Documentation Website (GitHub Pages)

EToolKit documentation and policy pages may be hosted on GitHub Pages.

When you open these pages, GitHub may receive standard web request data (such as IP address and browser information) as part of normal website operation.

---

## 4. Local Storage

EToolKit may store a local entitlement cache file on your device to reduce repeated license checks and improve performance.

Example location:  
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\EToolKit\entitlement_cache.json`

This cache is stored only on your device.

---

## 5. Security

EToolKit does not include spyware, malware, or tracking code.  
Network requests (such as entitlement validation) are made over HTTPS.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

EToolKit is not intended for individuals under the age of 18.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect the latest version.
